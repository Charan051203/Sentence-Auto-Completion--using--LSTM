# Sentence-Auto-Completion--using--LSTM
A Sentence Auto-Completion model built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in Python. This project uses the Holmes.txt dataset from Kaggle to train the model to predict and complete sentences based on given input text. The implementation is done in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging TensorFlow for deep learning.
